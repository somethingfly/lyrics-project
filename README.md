# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# What is this?

This is my lyrics project.
I have been wanting to make this for about 20 years.
Wish me luck.

## What does it do?

So, right now it probably just stores some test lyrics.
What I eventually want is that it connects to your database of lyrics (I'm not going to host it), or some database of your choosing.
You should be able to add to this database.
You should be able to modify this database.
You should be able to call to this database.
Someday, ideally, you'll have a music player playing on your device (computer, phone, etc.)
This "app" will read the info being shared about the song being played.
The "app" will display the lyrics.

## How is this different from other lyrics app except you get to set a database of your choosing?

Another feature I have envisioned for years is the ability to amalgamate a number of versions of the lyrics.
Let's say there are multiple versions with a different word here or there.
One version says the lyrics are "Happy mirthday to you."
As in, there is a special occassion called a "mirthday" where one should be mirthful.
And the speaker is trying to encourage one to have a happy mirthday, as it would be fitting.  Logical.
But another version says the lyrics are "Happy birthday to you."
That doesn't make much sense, one is only born once, and you are generally in no shape to enjoy, or be told to enjoy, that day.
Still, "Happy birthday to you" is actually in many versions.
So, "Happy birthday to you" is what you will see...  But with a squiggle under birthday.
Squiggles being the universal way of telling people something seems squiggly.
You click/tab the squiggle and see there are two options.  You select the one you like.
This locks in the option.  (It also gives that option a positive weighting if you are sharing with others on a database.)
Similarly, you will see a field in which you can write in what you think it is if neither fits.
For example, maybe it's the day that people get out of your way and leave you alone.
Maybe it's the day when people finally give you a wide berth.  Which would be joyous.
So you click "birthday" and instead type in "berthday."
That is now added to a version (your version) and it is possibly given weight.

## Further enhancement?

Sure, you could be given a rating as a lyrics provider or editor.
This can be based on the number of times others (if you share the database) agree with your version.
That could then increase your weighting.

## What about AI, couldn't AI do an even better job at lyric providing/editing?

Can we not talk about AI for once?  Just once.  Thanks.
